## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- I learn about the fundamentals of CSS GRID
- Adding template areas for grid wrapper
- Add template name for grid item

### Continued development

As I've seen the power of CSS GRID, I should I learn it more and use it for project
that has two dimensional layout

### Useful resources

- [CSS GRID Playground](https://grid.layoutit.com/) - This help me to determine what the grid layout should look like on my website rather than implementing it directly on the website itself.
- [CSS GRID Fundamentals](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand CSS GRID. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
